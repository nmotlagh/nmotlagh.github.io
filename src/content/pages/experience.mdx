intro: "Research, teaching, and internships — mostly focused on making ML systems more reliable."
items:
  - role: "Technical Analyst II — DCS Corp (sponsored by Air Force Research Laboratory)"
    location: "Dayton, OH"
    timeframe: "May 2025 — Present"
    bullets:
      - "Train and evaluate instruction-tuned LLMs with reject-option heads for analyst workflows, improving out-of-distribution utility by **8×** over competing approaches."
      - "Build evaluation harnesses and calibration dashboards that connect LLM policies to existing command-and-control tooling."
  - role: "Graduate Research Associate — Computer Vision Lab"
    location: "Ohio State University · Columbus, OH"
    timeframe: "Aug 2021 — Present"
    bullets:
      - "Lead the lab’s uncertainty-aware multimodal modeling portfolio under Prof. Jim Davis."
      - "Designed imagery-aware contrastive metrics for **multimodal machine translation** (WMT 2024), showing that state-of-the-art models depend on visual evidence rather than treating images as regularizers."
      - "Developed binomial per-class **reject-option training** for ImageNet, remote sensing, and long-tailed datasets (ISVC 2022 Best Paper; MVA 2025 extension), improving selective accuracy of vision transformers by **+0.4%** and coverage by **+1.3%**."
      - "Integrated these methods into open-source toolkits and analyst-facing evaluation pipelines."
  - role: "Graduate Teaching Associate — Machine Learning & NLP"
    location: "Ohio State University · Columbus, OH"
    timeframe: "Aug 2023 — Present"
    bullets:
      - "Support **80+ students** per offering in machine learning, computer vision, and natural language processing courses."
      - "Run recitations, office hours, and targeted study plans, and maintain auto-graded labs (including introductory LLM labs) with an emphasis on calibration, safety, and responsible deployment."
  - role: "Graduate Research Intern — Air Force Research Laboratory (U.S. CUI)"
    location: "Dayton, OH"
    timeframe: "Summers 2022–2024"
    bullets:
      - "Summer 2024: Adapted and trained **JEPA and MAE transformers** in a distributed Slurm/Singularity setup for multimodal EO/SAR representation learning, achieving superior low-data performance over supervised methods."
      - "Summer 2023: Developed **Reject Option Beam Search** to improve machine translation quality at large beam widths."
      - "Summer 2022: Pioneered an end-to-end training algorithm for Naturally Constrained Reject Option Classification."
  - role: "Undergraduate Research Intern — Air Force Research Laboratory (U.S. CUI)"
    location: "Dayton, OH"
    timeframe: "Summers 2020–2021"
    bullets:
      - "Summer 2021: Devised an **ensemble distillation** method to improve model performance on ambiguous instances."
      - "Summer 2020: Constructed a semi-automated system for **temporal satellite imagery collection** (ICCV 2021 workshop), later released as the Construction-Site-Satellite-Imagery dataset."
  - role: "Undergraduate Research Associate — Computer Vision Lab"
    location: "Ohio State University · Columbus, OH"
    timeframe: "2020 — 2021"
    bullets:
      - "Engineered semi-automatic labeling workflows for remote sensing change detection, creating Python tooling that bootstrapped datasets for uncertainty-aware modeling."
  - role: "Summer Research Intern — Sii Canada / Concordia University"
    location: "Montreal, QC"
    timeframe: "Summer 2019"
    bullets:
      - "Built anomaly detection dashboards that translated large-scale behavioral telemetry into prioritized experiments, highlighting early lessons on uncertainty estimation."
