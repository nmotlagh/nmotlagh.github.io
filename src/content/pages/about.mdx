I'm finishing my PhD at Ohio State, where I work on one of the quieter problems in ML: getting models to admit when they don't know something.

Modern AI systems are trained to always give an answer, even when they're guessing. My research develops training methods that teach models when to abstain — to say "I'm not confident" and hand off to a human instead.

Some recent wins:

- An LLM training approach that routes uncertain queries to humans, cutting errors dramatically on unfamiliar tasks
- Per-class rejection thresholds for vision models that improve accuracy without sacrificing coverage
- Evaluation methods for multimodal translation that show the models actually *use* the images

Day to day, I write Python and PyTorch, run experiments on HPC clusters, and build the plumbing that makes research usable — data pipelines, benchmarks, reproducible code.

Looking for research scientist or ML engineering roles in 2025. U.S. citizen, comfortable with CUI/DoD work.
