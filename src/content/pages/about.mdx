I'm a machine learning engineer and Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science and Engineering at The Ohio State University's Computer Vision Lab, advised by Prof. Jim Davis. I work on the boundary between research prototypes and production deployment for LLM and multimodal systems used in analyst-facing settings.

I design selective prediction policies, abstention heads, and evaluation harnesses so models know when to answer, when to abstain, and when to escalate to humans. Recent projects include:

- LLM reject-option training that delivers **8× higher utility** on out-of-distribution analyst tasks for defense partners.
- Binomial per-class reject-option training that improves selective accuracy and coverage of vision transformers on **ImageNet, remote sensing, and long-tailed datasets**.
- Imagery-aware evaluation for multimodal machine translation (WMT 2024), showing that state-of-the-art systems genuinely use pixels rather than treating images as regularizers.

On the engineering side, I work primarily in **Python and PyTorch** with **vision-language models**, **HuggingFace**, and **distributed training on Slurm/Singularity clusters**. I like building data pipelines, benchmarking harnesses, and lightweight services that plug into existing analyst tools.

I'm currently exploring **2025 research scientist and machine learning engineering roles** focused on LLMs, multimodal learning, and model reliability. I'm a **U.S. citizen** with experience working with controlled unclassified information (CUI) for DoD partners.
