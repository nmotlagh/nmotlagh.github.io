We present the invited journal extension of our reject-option work, showing how per-class binomial thresholds translate to dependable abstentions on ImageNet, long-tailed wildlife data, and remote-sensing pipelines. The paper details how to productionize the method with dataset-specific coverage targets, selective accuracy dashboards, and policy deployment checklists for ML and analyst teams.
