We detail a semi-automatic pipeline for collecting and labeling temporal satellite imagery using OpenStreetMap metadata, reducing manual annotation while surfacing dynamic regions of interest. The workflow feeds downstream change-detection and classification systems, accelerating monitoring initiatives such as construction tracking.
