We introduce a reject-option classification framework that learns per-class softmax thresholds from validation data, maximizing retained accuracy while delivering calibrated abstentions. The method underpins production guardrails across image, text, and 2-D benchmarks and received the **Best Paper Award** at ISVC 2022.
