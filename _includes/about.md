</div>

I am a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at Ohio State Universityâ€™s Computer Vision Lab, working under the guidance of Dr. Jim Davis. My research centers on evaluating and mitigating uncertainty in multimodal deep learning models, with a particular emphasis on vision-language models.

I have developed and applied Reject Option Classification methods to enhance user confidence in unimodal n-way classification models, which established a foundation for my current focus on understanding uncertainty in multimodal vision-language modeling. Additionally, I have conducted research in Machine Translation, proposing new metrics to assess the effectiveness of multimodal translation models in visual disambiguation.

I am actively seeking a research internship to leverage my interdisciplinary skills in a practical setting, aiming to contribute to innovative AI projects while expanding my research expertise.

I hold a B.S. in Computer Science from Ohio State University with a minor in Mathematics, which has provided a strong foundation in theoretical and applied computer science, driving my research and future aspirations in the field.
