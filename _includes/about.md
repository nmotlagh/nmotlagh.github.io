</div>

I am a third-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science, majoring in AI at Ohio State Universityâ€™s Computer Vision Lab. Under the guidance of [Dr. Jim Davis](http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~davis.1719/jwdavis.html), my research primarily focuses on the integration of multiple data modalities to enhance the reliability of artificial intelligence models, with a particular emphasis on vision and language models.

My work to date has involved the exploration and application of Reject Option Classification as a method to improve model robustness. This has laid the foundation for my current research direction, which is centered on multi-modal modeling. This transition represents an effort to bridge the gap between disparate data sources and modeling techniques, aiming to achieve more resilient and accurate AI systems.

In parallel with my academic pursuits, I am seeking opportunities for a research internship. My goal is to apply my interdisciplinary skills in a practical setting, contributing to innovative projects in the field of artificial intelligence while expanding my own research capabilities.

I hold an undergraduate degree in Computer Science from Ohio State University, complemented by a minor in Mathematics. This background has provided me with a solid foundation in both theoretical and applied aspects of computer science, informing my current research and future aspirations in the field.
