I am a 2nd year Ph.D. student in the Computer Vision Lab at Ohio State University, advised by Dr. [Jim Davis](http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~davis.1719/jwdavis.html). My research interests lie in machine learning and computer vision. Specifically, I am interested in developing uncertainty-aware models for various modalities.
